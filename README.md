talktime
========

Have you ever watched a political talk show and experienced that one of the participant got more talking time than the others?

This tool shall help you to track the talking time of each person. You enter the name of each person of the conversation in the input field and a button will get created with the name on it. The button also contains the current and the total speaking time of the person. In the upper right corner the whole total of the talk gets summed up.

Press the button with the talkers name on it, when the participant starts to speak.

Press the [stop timer] button on a break and the [reset] button to restart the complete session. All the information will not get stored. Make a screenshot whenever you like.
