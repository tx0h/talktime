talktime
========

Have you ever watched a political talk show and experienced, that one
participant got more talking time than the others?

This tool shall help you to track the talking time of each person. You enter
the name of each person of the conversation in the input field and a button will
get created with the name on it. The button also contains the current and the
total speaking time of the person. In the upper right corner the whole total
of the talk gets summed up.

Press the [stop timer] button on a break and the [reset] button to restart the
complete session. All the information didn't get stored. Make a screenshot
whenever you like.

The project is written in node and utilizes the express web server.
